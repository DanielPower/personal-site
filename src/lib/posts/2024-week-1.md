## I accomplished

- Migrated my Jellyfin server from my NAS to a dedicated server
- Setup Dynamic DNS using Cloudflare and
  [cloudflare-ddns](https://github.com/timothymiller/cloudflare-ddns)
- Migrated the styling of [SwiftSpider](https://journal.danielpower.ca) to
  Tailwind CSS

## I'm working on

### SwiftSpider

- Database encryption
- Styling / light and dark mode
- Database refactor to use json fields for node data
  - This is to handle planned functionality for user-defined node types

## I'm playing

- [Lethal Company](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1966720/Lethal_Company/)
- [Ready or Not](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1144200/Ready_or_Not/)

## I'm watching

- [Frieren: Beyond Journey's End](https://myanimelist.net/anime/52991/Sousou_no_Frieren)
  -- It's only half way through its run, and has already cemeted itself as one
  of the greatest animes of all time.

## I'm looking forward to

- The second half of Frieren: Beyond Journey's End
- Local game jam themed around card and board games
- My copy of [Shift Happens](https://shifthappens.site/) should ship soon

## Assorted thoughts

### In-game overlays

Overlays like those used by Discord and Steam aren't as simple as they seem. In
Windowed mode, you can render above the game window, but in Fullscreen mode this
is not possible. It seems the common solution is to write hooks for rendering
APIs, but this poses multiple challenges.

First, you need to write a hook for each API you want to support. Tedious but
achievable.

- DirectX 9, 10, 11, 12
- OpenGL
- Vulkan
- Metal
- SDL, SFML, etc.

The bigger issue is that these hooks can be detected by anti-cheat software, and
may be mistaken for cheats, and result in a ban. In fact, even major software
like Discord has had incidents of user bans due to their overlay.

This creates a huge barrier to entry for any new software implementing an
overlay. It seems that Discord, Steam, and other major companies are only able
to do this because they have a large enough user base for anti-cheat developers
to implement exclusions.
