## Bambu P1S arrived

My P1S finally arrived after being delayed by the snowstorm. I'm impressed with
how quick it was to setup and how well it worked out of the box. Coming from an
Ender 3 V2, it's a huge upgrade. It auto-levels, gets a perfect first layer
every time, and prints so much faster.

Since I'm mostly interested in functional prints and prototyping, I opted for
the 0.8mm nozzle. That shaved about 33% off of print times, even compared to the
already fast out of the box printing.

So far I've just been printing some stuff from Thingiverse to test it out.

## Learning SCAD

I'm hoping to start designing custom keyboard cases and other functional prints.
So I want to learn SCAD, since I think expressing the design in code will be
more intuitive for me than using a GUI.

My first evening using SCAD was a little rough, since I spent a while tracking
down a rendering bug present in the latest stable release _which was released in
2021_. It seems the project is still active, but the stable release is ancient.
Grabbing the latest nightly build resolved the issue.

## I've been playing

Finally gave Vampire Survivors a try. It's a fun gimmick, easy way to kill some
times.

Started playing Persona 5 again. I've been thoroughly enjoying it, but like any
game of its size I have trouble sticking with it. Switched the dialog to
Japanese (English text) to get some immersion practice.

osu! released a huge performance update. Lazer finally feels snappy with no
noticeable stuttering. I may be doomed if this causes the return of my circle
clicking addiction.

## Japanese progress

Ni No Kuni was a struggle. I'm not quite ready for it yet. Still keeping up with
my Renshuu studies, and nearly done with the Japanese Basics section. Going to
keep up my daily Renshuu routine, and potentially switch to a Pokemon game for
immersion since it's more text-light. I have Pocket Monsters Red (Pokemon Red)
ready to go on my Steam Deck.
