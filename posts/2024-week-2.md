## I'm learning

- [Boardgame.io](https://boardgame.io/)
  - It's a frontend framework agnostic library for making board games.
  - It uses a state machine to manage the game state, and manages syncing that state between
    clients.
  - Hoping to use this for an upcoming local game jam.

## I accomplished

- Completed Section 1 Unit 4 of Japanese on Duolingo
- Put together a simple demo integrating boardgame.io with Svelte
  - [Repository](https://github.com/DanielPower/boardgame.io-svelte-test)
- Helped a friend build their new gaming PC
- Met quota, and was a valuable asset for [the company](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uFp8AhXMio)

## Assorted thoughts

- Sad to see both MatPat and Tom Scott are retiring / stepping back from their Youtube channels.
  I've been enjoying both their content for nearly a decade. I wish them the best. They've earned
  it.
  - [MatPat - Goodbye Internet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1_TqU68yo)
  - [Tom Scott - After ten years, it's time to stop making videos.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DKv5H5Frt0)
- Setting up email notifications on my NAS was a mistake. The emails never end.
  - Configuration needed :'(
